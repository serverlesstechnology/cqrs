# CQRS and Event Sourcing using Rust

The [`cqrs-es` crate](https://crates.io/crates/cqrs-es) 
provides a lightweight framework for building applications utilizing CQRS and event sourcing. 
The project targets serverless architectures but can be used in any application seeking to utilize these patterns to 
build better software.

[Chapter 1](theory.html) provides an introduction to CQRS and event sourcing as well as the underlying design strategy
that they support, Domain Driven Design. This chapter is essential reading for anyone not familiar with these topics.
 
[Chapter 2](getting_started.html) provides a tutorial for getting started with the framework. This involves building
an aggregate, commands, events and the associated trait implementations for a basic CQRS system. Our demo application
will simulate a simple bank account 

[Chapter 3](add_first_test.html) covers the basics of implementing domain tests. The ability to simply build supple
tests are one of the primary benefits of a CQRS system, and here we explain how to effectively build these.

[Chapter 4](test_application.html) covers building a simple query processor as well as putting all of these components
together in a proper CQRS framework. We will use a naive, in-memory event store to facilitate this mini-application that
will allow us to explore CQRS with simple unit tests.

[Chapter 5](building_an_application.html) discusses the additional features needed to work this framework into a real
application. 

[Chapter 6](advanced_topics.html) branches out to some of the more advanced topics permitted by these patterns,
including event replay and upcasting.
