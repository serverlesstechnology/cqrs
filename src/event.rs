/// A `DomainEvent` represents any business change in the state of an `Aggregate`. `DomainEvent`s
/// are immutable, and when
/// [event sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)
/// is used they are the single source of truth.
///
/// The name of a `DomainEvent` should always be in the past tense, e.g.,
/// - AdminPrivilegesGranted
/// - EmailAddressChanged
/// - DependencyAdded
///
/// To simplify serialization, an event should be an enum, and each variant should carry any
/// important information.
///
/// Though the `DomainEvent` trait only has a single function, the events must also derive a
/// number of standard traits.
/// - `Clone` - events may be cloned throughout the framework, particularly when applied to queries
/// - `Serialize` and `Deserialize` - required for persistence
/// - `PartialEq` and `Debug` - needed for effective testing
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// # use cqrs_es::doc::Customer;
/// # use cqrs_es::{Aggregate,DomainEvent};
/// # use serde::{Serialize,Deserialize};
/// #[derive(Clone,Debug,Serialize,Deserialize,PartialEq)]
/// pub enum CustomerEvent {
///     NameChanged{ changed_name: String },
///     EmailUpdated{ new_email: String },
/// }
/// ```

/// `EventEnvelope` is a data structure that encapsulates an event with its pertinent
/// information.
/// All of the associated data will be transported and persisted together and will be available
/// for queries.
///
/// Within any system an event must be unique based on the compound key composed of its:
/// - [`aggregate_type`](https://docs.rs/cqrs-es/latest/cqrs_es/trait.Aggregate.html#tymethod.aggregate_type)
/// - `aggregate_id`
/// - `sequence`
///
/// Thus an `EventEnvelope` provides a uniqueness value along with an event `payload` and
/// `metadata`.
