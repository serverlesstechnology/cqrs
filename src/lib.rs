//! 
//! **A lightweight, opinionated CQRS and event sourcing framework targeting serverless architectures.**

//! ---
//! 
//! ## Installation
//! 
//! cqrs-es is available from Crates.io or Github.
//! 
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! cqrs-es = "0.0.3"
//! ```
//! 
//! Or for a specific branch
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! cqrs-es = { git = "https://github.com/serverlesstechnology/cqrs.git", branch = "master"}
//! ```
//! 
//! ## Opinions
//! 
//! - Aggregate persistence is via event sourcing only.
//! - Metadata is implemented only as a `HashMap<String,String>`. 
//! Further, the `MetadataSupplier` that the user provides has no insight into the event or aggregate that 
//! it supplies metadata for. This may be changed.
//! - JSON serialization only.
//! - Generics are preferred over boxed traits.
//! - Persistence is implemented through a Postgres database.
//! 
//! ## Todos/research
//! 
//! - Event upcasters.
//! - Some additional framework around `GenericViewRepository` to simplify event replay.
//! - Explore options for increasing the usefulness of `MetadataSupplier`.
//! - Event serialization uses the event type as the root node of the JSON tree. This simplifies
//! deserialization but is non-standard.
//! - Paging for PostgresEventStore
//! - Persistence implementation for DynamoDb.
